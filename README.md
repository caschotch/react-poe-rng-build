#Path of Exile Random Character Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## History

I had originally created this with just some basic Javascript and HTML for a project while going through [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io). 

However, once I had gone through an excellent React course, thanks to [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com), I decided to redo the entire project as a single page react app. 

This should allow for future changes to be made more easily with the component and mainly give me more practice.
